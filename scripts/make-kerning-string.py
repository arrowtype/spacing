"""
    A simple way to make some kerning strings, for kerning and/or proofing your kerning.
    
    Use glyph names to generate a kerning proof for e.g. RoboFont Space Center.
    
    You can also edit this to use characters: exclude the spaces, leave out the .split(" "), 
    and remove the slashes and spaces from the pattern.

# Change to a space (`" "`) if you want to only use spaces, e.g. as one option for an easy InDesign proof (newlines & columns might be better, though).
# Change to "\\n" at the end of your pattern if you want your output to include newlines in the RoboFont space center.
